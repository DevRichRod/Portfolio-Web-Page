          <h2>About Dev Rich Rod</h2>
          <p class="width">Prior to being a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/software-engineer-career-path/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I graduted colledge and found a career as a sheet metal specialist. I dedicated six years of my life increasing and growing skills in that field. I took all my work personally and with great care, but I needed something more, something with room for growth and inovation. With that being said, I was ready for the next journey, which led me to software development!</p>
          <p>Being a huge gamer and user of many applications in this field since I was a child, I was always fascinated and curious about how apps, websites, and especially games worked. I wanted to extend my knowledge and contribution to the practice. I am more than ready to collaborate with others to not only learn, but to make something great! </p>
